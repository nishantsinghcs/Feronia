                 <h4>As we know, Ayurveda is a ancient science of well being as well as an art of daily living in harmony with rules and regulations
     of the nature. The aims and objectives of this holy science are to maintain the healthy and perfect breath of healthy person as well as animal 
     ngdom through prevention and to cure the diseases. In Indian culture, the service to the animals and their care has always been given a very pious place. 
    They need our care and being the most intelligent creatures of the almighty, it is our duties to take care of those who cant express their 
    pain and sufferings. 
    We here at Feronia, are doing the same thing. 
    Now a days, a number of manufacturers are making veterinary supplements and probably we are amongst newest of them. But, our motto is,
     to give a healthcare to the animals, which a farmer, society and country can accept without thinking of any undesirable side effects, because what we use to manufacture products are the purest herbs suggested by our ancient rishis and also authoritative books of Ayurveda, and as we know, are most of the times devoid of any side effects. We are not here for just making profits like others do, also we are not here to
      push our farmers under the heavy cost burden of medicines, but what we want is a healthcare not only for the illness for also a complete
       health protection of animals.
  Our drugs are manufactured in accordance with the latest literature based on authoritative books.
  We fundamentally understand, develop and improve our competencies and technologies through product, process and quality excellence having standard of effectiveness. We will also try to expand our market opportunities by introducing unique products to provide healthy service for suffering animals.
